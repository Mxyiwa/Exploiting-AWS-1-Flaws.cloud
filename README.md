<h2>Description</h2>
<b>This project is designed to teach you common mistakes and gotchas when using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
</b>
<br />
<br />
There are 6 levels to complete the challenge. A series of hints are provided at each level to help teach you how to discover the information you will need at your current or next level. At the start of each level, you will learn how to avoid the problem the previous level exhibited.
<br />

<h2>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h2>

- <b>Level 2: Misconfigured Bucket Permissions</b>
- <b>Level 3: Leaked Access Keys</b>
- <b>Level 4</b>
- <b>Level 5</b>
- <b>Level 6</b>

<h2>Level 1: Buckets of Fun</h2>
<b>Like the title of the level implies, when dealing with buckets in AWS, the first thing to come to mind is Amazon S3. This means static websites like flaws.cloud can be hosted on S3.
